# Goals

-   Separation of concern
    -   Application logic should be separate from UI structure from look and feel (css)
-   Semantics
    -   Components should describe use or meaning and not describe look
-   Customizability
-   Performance
    -   Components should be performant by default
    -   e.g. rendering a table of 1 million elements should be fast

# Features

-   Full featured UI controls

# Design Principles

-   Different UI components for different behaviours
